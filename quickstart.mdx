## Create Your First AI Voice Agent

Get up and running with Recepta AI in just a few simple steps. This guide will walk you through creating your first AI voice agent and setting up a chat widget.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up and Account Setup">
    1. Visit [recepta.ai](https://recepta.ai) and create your account
    2. Verify your email address
    3. Complete the onboarding questionnaire about your business
    
    <Note>
      During signup, you'll be asked about your business type, target audience, and use cases. This helps us customize your initial agent configuration.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Business Information">
    Set up your business profile to help the AI understand your context:
    
    - **Business Name & Description**: How your AI agent will introduce your company
    - **Industry & Services**: What your business offers to customers  
    - **Target Audience**: Who your typical customers are
    - **Operating Hours**: When your agent should be active
    
    ```javascript
    // Example business configuration
    {
      "name": "Acme Consulting",
      "description": "We provide business consulting services for small businesses",
      "industry": "Professional Services",
      "services": ["Business Strategy", "Marketing", "Operations"],
      "hours": "9 AM - 6 PM EST, Monday - Friday"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your AI Voice">
    Select the perfect voice for your brand:
    
    - **Voice Options**: Choose from 20+ professional AI voices
    - **Languages**: Support for English, Spanish, French, German, and more
    - **Tone**: Professional, friendly, casual, or formal
    - **Speed**: Adjust speaking rate for your audience
    
    <Tip>
      Listen to voice samples in the dashboard to find the perfect match for your brand personality.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Agent Prompts">
    Define how your AI agent should behave:
    
    - **General Prompt**: Overall personality and behavior guidelines
    - **Specific Scenarios**: How to handle common customer requests
    - **Fallback Responses**: What to say when uncertain
    - **Transfer Rules**: When to escalate to human agents
    
    ```text
    Example General Prompt:
    "You are a helpful customer service representative for Acme Consulting. 
    Be professional but friendly. Always ask for the caller's name and 
    reason for calling. If you can't answer a question, offer to have 
    someone call them back within 24 hours."
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Your Phone Number">
    Set up a dedicated phone number for your AI agent:
    
    - **Choose Area Code**: Select from available numbers
    - **Forward Calls**: Option to forward to existing numbers
    - **Voicemail Setup**: Configure after-hours handling
    - **Call Recording**: Enable for quality and training
    
    <Warning>
      Phone numbers are allocated immediately. Make sure you're ready to start receiving calls before completing this step.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Agent">
    Before going live, test your configuration:
    
    1. Use the **Test Call** feature in the dashboard
    2. Try different conversation scenarios
    3. Verify voice quality and response accuracy
    4. Check call transfer functionality
    5. Test after-hours behavior
